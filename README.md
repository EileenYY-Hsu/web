# Tamkang University Confession Board System â€“ A Web Forum Developed with PHP & MySQL.
An interactive platform that enables users to log in, log out, create posts, submit comments, and perform queries, among other core functionalities.
## Project Motivation
The development of this project reflects my strong interest in web application development and database-driven platforms. By building a forum system with login, posting, and commenting functionalities, my goal was to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development using PHP and MySQL.

This project also demonstrates my enthusiasm for designing user-centered interfaces and implementing backend logic. I plan to include it in my portfolio for applying to graduate programs in Computer Science, particularly in the areas of software engineering, system development, and applied data processing.
